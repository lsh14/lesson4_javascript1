### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (While html is good for developing static web pages, JavaScript can make a page nicer by making it interactive/reactive.)
2. (There are many mistakes that can happen in JavaScript, and one of the most common is confusing addition and concatenation. Addition is about adding numbers while concatenation is about adding strings.)
3. (JavaScript supports two numeric data types, integers and floating-point numbers. An integer is a positibe or negative number with no decimal places, and a floating-point number is a number containing decimal places or written in exponential notation.)
